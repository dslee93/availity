//1.Coding exercise(using C#): You are tasked to write a checker that validates the parentheses of a LISP code. Write a
//program which takes in a string as an input and returns true if all the parentheses in the string are properly closed
//and nested.

// Insert your lisp here.... also confused on what a lisp actually is
var lisp = "(example lisp sentence)";
lisp.ValidateParentheses();

//2.Coding exercise(using C#): Availity receives enrollment files from various benefits management and enrollment
//solutions (I.e.HR platforms, payroll platforms).  Most of these files are typically in EDI format.  However, there are
//some files in CSV format.  For the files in CSV format, write a program that will read the content of the file and
//separate enrollees by insurance company in its own file. Additionally, sort the contents of each file by last and first
//name (ascending).  Lastly, if there are duplicate User Ids for the same Insurance Company, then only the record
//with the highest version should be included. The following data points are included in the file:
